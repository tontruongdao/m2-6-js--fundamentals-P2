We want a function that can transform it from that shape to this shape:

{
  "name": "Will Byers",
  "age": 9,
  "status": "upside down",
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "123 Whatever street",
    "city": "Hawkins",
    "state": "Indiana",
    "country": "United States"
  },
  "superpowers": [
    "can-blink-lights"
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "type": "mother",
      "name": "Joyce Byers",
      "age": 35,
      "status": "worried",
      "superpowers": []
    },
    {
      "type": "girlfriend",
      "name": "Eleven",
      "age": 9,
      "status": "angry",
      "superpowers": [
        "telepathy",
        "multiverse portal sealing"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Specifically:

- Address becomes nested in an object
- Instead of `superpower1` and `superpower2`, an array is used
- Instead of having a "flat" structure for relationships, a new `relationships`
  array is added, which holds objects for each relationship.
- Each relationship has a `type`, like mother/best-friend/girlfriend
- Each relationship also has an array of super powers, same logic as the main
  `superpowers` array

NOTE: For superpowers, you should only have as many items as are available.
For example, the main superpowers array should be:
✅ ['can-blink-lights']
⛔️ ['can-blink-lights', null]
